## MovieThon Overview
### Project Description
This project must meet 4 technical requirements:
1) A complete product
2) Implement thoughtful user stories
3) Deployed online
4) Use something new I haven't learned

### User Stories
As a user, I will be greeted with a small animation that leads to the I will arrive at a home screen that will provide two options:
1) Login to an existing account
2) Signup for a new account to experience the wonder of MovieThon

Once logged in, users will reach the main page which will have the three categories of movies in a row. There will be a navbar that have the user's watchlist, a search, a profile picture, & a menu button. A visual of the main page is provided below.

### MVP Goals
In order to achieve what is considered a minimal viable product (MVP), I would need to achieve four things:
1) Fetch from the appropriate API endpoints & have those endpoints render the data on the app.
2) The user must have the ability to create an account & login when they want.
3) The user must be able to leave a comment on a desired movie & with the ability for other users to view
4) Minimal styling

### Stretch Goals
1) Search bar functionality in the Navbar
2) Watchlist functionality in the Navbar
3) Users editing their profile
4) Users following other users
